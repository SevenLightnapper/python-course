# Module 3: Deeper into the functions

## Module Description
This module focuses on Python namespaces and functions, including function parameters, 
call counting, recursion, and unpacking arguments.

### Assignment 1: Homework on "Namespaces"
- **[Solution](./hw1)**
- **Description:**
  **Task "Call Counter"**
  - Write 3 functions:
    1. `count_calls`: Tracks how many times other functions are called.
    2. `string_info`: Takes a string and returns a tuple containing its length, 
    uppercase version, and lowercase version.
    3. `is_contains`: Takes a string and a list, 
    returning True if the string is in the list (case-insensitive), False otherwise.
  - Track the number of times the functions are called using a counter.

### Assignment 2: Homework on "Ways to Call Functions"
- **[Solution](./hw2)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Email Sending":**
  - Create a function `send_email` with parameters for message, recipient, 
  and a named argument for sender with a default value.
  - Implement logic to check if emails are valid, prevent sending an email to oneself, 
  and differentiate between default and custom senders.

### Assignment 3: Homework on "Unpacking Positional Parameters"
- **[Solution](./hw3)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Unpacking":**
  - Create a function `print_params` with default parameters, test it with various argument combinations, 
  and demonstrate the use of argument unpacking from lists and dictionaries.

### Assignment 4: Homework on "Arbitrary Number of Parameters"
- **[Solution](./hw4)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Single Root Words":**
  - Write a function `single_root_words` that accepts a root word and a variable number of additional words, 
  returning a list of words that either contain the root word or are contained by it.

### Assignment 5: Independent Work on "Recursion"
- **[Solution](./hw5)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Recursive Digit Multiplication":**
  - Write a recursive function `get_multiplied_digits` that calculates the product of the digits of a given number.

### Additional Assignment: Practical Exercise on "More About Functions"
- **[Solution](./hw6)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "One, Two, Three, Four... Is That All?":**
  - Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers and the lengths of all strings in a nested data structure, 
  which may include lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
