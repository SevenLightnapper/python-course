# Module 7: Working with Files and Formatted Output

## Module Description
This module focuses on file handling in Python, covering different file operations, modes, file positioning, 
and string formatting techniques.

### Assignment 1: Homework on "File Opening Modes"
- **[Solution](./path/to/assignment1)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Product Inventory":**
  - Implement two classes, `Product` and `Shop`. 
    The `Product` class represents a product with attributes such as name, weight, and category. 
    The `Shop` class manages the inventory by reading from and writing to a file, preventing duplicate entries.

### Assignment 2: Homework on "File Positioning"
- **[Solution](./path/to/assignment2)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Write and Remember":**
  - Implement a function `custom_write` that writes a list of strings to a file 
    and returns a dictionary mapping the line number and byte position of each string.

### Assignment 3: Homework on "With Statement"
- **[Solution](./path/to/assignment3)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "Find It Everywhere":**
  - Implement a `WordsFinder` class that takes a list of file names 
    and provides methods to get all words from the files, find the first occurrence of a word, 
    and count the number of occurrences of a word across all files.

### Assignment 4: Homework on "String Formatting"
- **[Solution](./path/to/assignment4)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "String Formatting":**
  - Write code that formats strings using different formatting methods: `%`, `.format()`, 
    and f-strings, for various scenarios involving team statistics, competition results, and task completion times.

### Assignment 5: Homework on "File System Operations"
- **[Solution](./path/to/assignment5)**
- **Description:** 
  **Task "File Operations in the OS":**
  - Use `os.walk` to traverse directories, `os.path.join` to construct file paths, 
    and methods such as `os.path.getmtime`, `os.path.getsize`, and `os.path.dirname` 
    to retrieve file modification times, sizes, and parent directories.
